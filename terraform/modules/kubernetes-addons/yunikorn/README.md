# YuniKorn Helm Chart

## What is YuniKorn
[YuniKorn](https://yunikorn.apache.org/) Resource Scheduler for K8s. Fully K8s compatible, an alternative of the default K8s scheduler, but more powerful. Transparent for the existing K8s applications.

[Apache YuniKorn (Incubating)](https://yunikorn.apache.org/) is a new Apache incubator project that offers rich scheduling capabilities on Kubernetes. It fills the scheduling gap while running Big Data workloads on Kubernetes, with a ton of useful features such as hierarchical queues, elastic queue quotas, resource fairness, and job ordering.
